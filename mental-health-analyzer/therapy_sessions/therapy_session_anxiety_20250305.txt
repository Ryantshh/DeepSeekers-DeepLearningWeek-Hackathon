Therapist: Hello, how have you been doing since our last session?

Patient: I've been feeling really on edge. It seems like it's been getting worse over the past couple of weeks.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what "on edge" feels like for you?

Patient: It's like I'm constantly waiting for something bad to happen. My heart races a lot, and I feel this tightness in my chest. Sometimes I'll be doing something completely normal, like grocery shopping, and suddenly I feel like I can't breathe and need to leave immediately.

Therapist: That sounds difficult. Have you noticed any specific triggers for these feelings?

Patient: That's the frustrating part - it seems to happen randomly. Though work deadlines definitely make it worse. Last Thursday, my boss mentioned an upcoming presentation, and I immediately felt my heart pounding so hard I thought everyone could see it through my shirt. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom where I spent 15 minutes trying to calm down.

Therapist: How have these feelings been affecting your daily activities?

Patient: I've started avoiding certain situations. I canceled dinner with friends twice because the thought of being in a crowded restaurant made me feel panicky. And I've been taking the stairs at work because the idea of being trapped in the elevator feels unbearable. Yesterday I had to drive around the parking garage for 20 minutes until I found a spot near the exit because I was worried about getting trapped.

Therapist: You mentioned feeling like you can't breathe sometimes. Can you describe those episodes more?

Patient: It's terrifying. My chest gets tight, I can't catch my breath, and I feel lightheaded. During the worst one last week, my hands went numb and tingly, and I was convinced I was having a heart attack. My roommate wanted to call an ambulance, but it passed after about 15 minutes. These episodes make me afraid to go places alone in case it happens again.

Therapist: How have you been sleeping?

Patient: Terribly. I lie awake worrying about everything - work, my health, my relationships, even world events that I have no control over. My mind just won't shut off. When I do fall asleep, I often wake up around 3 AM with my heart racing from some nightmare I can't even remember. I'm lucky if I get 4-5 hours of broken sleep.

Therapist: Have you noticed yourself worrying about things that others might consider small matters?

Patient: All the time. Yesterday I spent two hours obsessing over an email I sent that had a tiny grammar mistake. I was convinced my colleague would think I was incompetent. And last week, a friend didn't text me back for a day, and I created this entire scenario in my head that she was angry with me. Turns out her phone was just broken.

Therapist: How do you feel physically throughout all this?

Patient: Exhausted but somehow still wound up. My muscles are constantly tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I've been getting these intense headaches, and my stomach is a mess. I've had diarrhea several times a week, and sometimes I feel too nauseated to eat properly.

Therapist: Have you found anything that helps reduce these feelings, even temporarily?

Patient: The breathing exercises you taught me help sometimes, but it's hard to remember to do them when I'm in the middle of panicking. Going for walks helps a bit too. But honestly, the only thing that really works is avoiding situations that make me anxious, which I know isn't a good long-term strategy.

Therapist: You mentioned worrying about your health. Can you tell me more about those concerns?

Patient: I've become hyperaware of every body sensation. If my chest hurts, I think heart attack. If I have a headache, I worry it's a brain tumor. Two days ago, I had a slight cough and immediately started worrying it was COVID or pneumonia. I've checked my temperature probably 20 times this week alone.

Therapist: That sounds really exhausting to live with. How has this been affecting your relationships?

Patient: I think I'm pushing people away. I've canceled plans so many times that friends have stopped inviting me. And when I am with people, I'm not really present because I'm so caught up in my anxious thoughts or monitoring my body for signs of panic. My partner says I seem distant and irritable, but I don't know how to explain what I'm going through.

Therapist: These are all important things for us to address. Let's talk about some strategies we can implement to help manage these symptoms...
